# Setup Guide

## Hardware Requirements

### **1. Your Base Device**
Youâ€™ll need a device to act as your server. Here are some options:
- **MacBook Pro or Desktop Computer** (recommended for beginners):
  - Ideal if youâ€™re testing or using this system personally.
- **Raspberry Pi**:
  - A low-cost, energy-efficient option for 24/7 operation.
- **Old PC or Laptop**:
  - Repurpose your existing hardware as a dedicated server.

### **2. Storage Options**
Your storage requirements depend on the size and type of files youâ€™ll store:
- **External Hard Drives**:
  - Affordable and easy to expand (e.g., 1TB drives start at ~$50).
- **Internal Drives** (for PCs):
  - Use SSDs for faster performance or HDDs for larger storage at a lower cost.
- **Network Attached Storage (NAS)**:
  - Best for advanced users requiring expandable, professional-grade storage.

## Software Requirements

### **1. Operating System**
Choose an operating system to run your cloud storage software:
- **macOS** (if using a MacBook Pro).
- **Ubuntu or Debian Linux** (ideal for Raspberry Pi or PCs).
- **Windows** (optional but less common for this purpose).

### **2. Cloud Storage Software**
Weâ€™ll use **Nextcloud** for this guide. Itâ€™s a free, open-source platform that provides:
- File storage and sharing.
- Synchronization across devices.
- Built-in security features.

You can also explore:
- **TrueNAS**: Great for NAS setups.
- **OpenMediaVault**: Lightweight and beginner-friendly.

### **3. Additional Tools**
- **Web Server Software**:
  - **Apache** or **Nginx** (required for hosting Nextcloud).
- **Database**:
  - **MariaDB** or **MySQL** for managing cloud data.
- **SSL Certificate**:
  - Use Letâ€™s Encrypt for secure HTTPS access.
