### The True Costs of Public Cloud Storage:

- **Ongoing Fees**: The average household spends $200‚Äì$500 a year on cloud subscriptions. Imagine where that money could go instead‚Äîfamily vacations, education, or investments.
- **Lack of Privacy**: Many cloud providers can access your files. Even if they promise not to, the potential for breaches or misuse remains.
- **Data Vulnerability**: Relying on a third-party provider means putting your trust in their security measures, which may not always be foolproof.

### Why Private Cloud is the Answer:

- **Save Money**: A one-time setup cost saves you from endless fees.  
- **Full Privacy**: Your files stay in your hands‚Äîalways.  
- **Enhanced Security**: With tools like SSL encryption and firewalls, you control your own protection.
