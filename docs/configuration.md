- **Secure Passwords**: Set strong, unique passwords for all user accounts.  
- **Disable Unnecessary Ports**: Minimize vulnerabilities by closing unused ports.  
- **Enable Logging**: Keep track of access logs to monitor activity and detect potential threats.

## Performance Tweaks

- **Enable Caching**: Speed up data access with caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached.  
- **Optimize Storage**: Configure RAID or other storage management systems for redundancy and performance.  
- **Network Configuration**: Use Quality of Service (QoS) settings to prioritize cloud traffic.

## User Management

- **Create User Accounts**: Add and manage users with appropriate permissions.  
- **Set Roles**: Assign roles (e.g., admin, guest) to control access levels.  
- **Organize Data**: Structure folders and files logically for easier access and management.
