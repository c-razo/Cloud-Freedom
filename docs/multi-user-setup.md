# Multi-User Setup

## Overview
With a multi-user setup, you can create separate accounts for family members, team members, or colleagues, each with customized permissions. This allows you to share files securely while maintaining control over who can access what.

## Step 1: Adding Users
1. Log in to your Nextcloud Admin account.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Users**.
3. Click the **+ New User** button.
4. Enter the new userâ€™s:
   - **Username**: Unique identifier for their account.
   - **Email Address**: For password recovery and notifications.
   - **Password**: (Optional) Set a temporary password or allow the user to create their own.
5. Assign the user to a group (e.g., "Family," "Team") if applicable.

## Step 2: Assigning Roles and Permissions
1. Go to the **Users** tab.
2. Select the newly created user.
3. Assign a role:
   - **Admin**: Full control over files and settings.
   - **User**: Limited to accessing and managing their files.
4. Set folder permissions:
   - Navigate to the shared folder.
   - Click **Share** and select the user.
   - Choose their access level:
     - **Can edit**: Allows uploading and editing files.
     - **Read-only**: View files but no changes allowed.

## Step 3: Shared Folders for Groups
1. Go to the **Files** tab.
2. Create a new folder (e.g., "Team Files").
3. Share the folder with a group:
   - Click the **Share** icon.
   - Add the group name (e.g., "Team").
   - Set permissions for the group:
     - **Can edit**: All group members can upload and edit files.
     - **Read-only**: Members can view files only.

## Best Practices
- Encourage users to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for added security.
- Regularly review permissions to ensure no unauthorized access.
- Assign Admin roles only to trusted users.
