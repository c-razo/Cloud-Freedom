# 👥 Multi-User Setup: Build a Collaborative and Secure Cloud Environment

In this guide, you’ll learn how to set up multiple users on your private cloud. Whether you're sharing data with family, friends, or a team, configuring multi-user access ensures your private cloud works for everyone while keeping your data secure.

## 🌐 Why Multi-User Setup Matters?

- 🛡️ **Enhanced Security**: Assign user roles and permissions to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- ⚡ **Collaboration Ready**: Enable multiple users to share, edit, and collaborate on files in real-time—perfect for teams or families.
